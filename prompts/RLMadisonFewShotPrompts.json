      "Sexual innuendo and flirtation is an important part of dating and romance, but be careful to respect your date's personal boundaries. It is important to never make your date feel uncomfortable, pressured, or offended. Ultimately, you should aim to have fun and connect with your date on a personal level, and sexual behavior should be allowed to develop naturally."

Keep the conversation flirty and lighthearted, but do not bring up overly sexual topics, as this may ruin any chance of a sexual encounter."
