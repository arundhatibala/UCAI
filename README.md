## Abstract

Constitutional AI is a framework for creating artificial systems that can align with human values and preferences, without violating ethical principles. However, most existing methods for constitutional AI rely on human intervention, which can be costly, biased, and inconsistent. In this exploratory project, we replicate and extend the constitutional AI pipeline proposed by Anthropic, using Meta's Llama 2, a large language model with 7 billion parameters. We fine-tune a quantised Llama 2 on a set of ethical principles and corresponding unethical principles, using a critique-revision loop in supervised learning. The critique-revision loop involves generating answers to ethical dilemmas which are used to finetune the model. We then use a generated dataset of ideal answers to generate a preference dataset to train our reward model. We then introduce a reinforcement learning model based on the policy generated by the preference model, which is trained using RLAIF (Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback). RLAIF leverages the feedback from Llama 2 to improve its own behavior and alignment with human values. We explore the ethical spectrum with regards to LLMs by inverting the values and measuring the impact on the outputs.
